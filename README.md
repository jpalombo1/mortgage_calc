# Mortgage Calc

Instead of using Excel, just use python to compose a mortgage calculation. Also calculates how changes in output parameter like mortgage monthly payment, lifetime payment, etc, would require how much delta change in input params like down payment, taxes, interest rate, and house cost.

Install with `pip install .` at root. Run with `python main.py`.  
Modify `data/mortgage.yaml` for mortgage params and analysis sweeps/ percent changes in params.
